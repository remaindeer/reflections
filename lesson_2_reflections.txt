-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository we give the command to git that it needs to be able to track changes in that specific directory from that moment. We need to do it 
in order to make sure we can create new commits and those commits will be saved.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is different in that, it gives you more flexibility in terms of what "snapshot" you want to save. It doesn't force you to commit all the files in your working
directory at the same time.
